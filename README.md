# Gundam_Bot (Guide to ROS2 usage as well)
Personal experiment to test out using my knowledge of ROS2 and Gazebo (both of which I'm learning)

ðŸ‘‹ Hello fellow robotics enjoyer, With this repository I aim to config the files in a way you can setup a similar bot for your own needs 
Before we start working on the bot, ensure necessary packages are installed. I am using Jazzy Jalisco as it is the latest version of ROS2
you can use other versions as well such as rolling , iron etc. so be sure to replace the distro name from 'jazzy' to '{your_distro_name}'
```bash
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
```

this command creates an underlay 

these two packages are quite important for the program and rviz to work :-

```bash
sudo apt install ros-jazzy-joint-state-publisher
sudo apt install ros-jazzy-joint-state-publisher-gui
```

xacro is also a useful tool which will come in handy for this program

```bash
sudo apt install ros-jazzy-xacro
```
